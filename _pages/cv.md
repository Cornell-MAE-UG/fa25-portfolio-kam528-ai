#### Projects
- **ASTRA Lab: Electrospray Propulsion Emitters**:
  *Design, fabrication, and analysis of microfabricated emitter geometries for electrospray propulsion systems*
  - Designed and evaluated multiple emitter geometries, including angled vertical capillaries, curved capillaries, and TPMS-based structures
  - Used high-resolution 3D microfabrication techniques to manufacture emitters with controlled nanoscale features
  - Analyzed the influence of geometry on propellant distribution, emission stability, and flow behavior
  - Supported experimental testing and characterization to inform future emitter design iterations

- **DBF Project Team Aircraft**:
  *Design–Build–Fly (DBF) competition aircraft developed as part of a multidisciplinary project team*
  - Contributed to the structural and aerodynamic design of the aircraft, including wing design and integration
  - Performed analysis to evaluate aircraft performance and structural behavior prior to flight testing
  - Supported fabrication, assembly, and iterative testing of the aircraft
  - Participated in flight testing, including a successful first flight demonstrating stable takeoff, flight, and landing

  - **Heat Exchanger Analysis**:
  *Experimental analysis of a water-to-water heat exchanger under multiple flow configurations*
  - Conducted experimental testing of a small-scale heat exchanger using parallel flow, counterflow, and varied operating conditions
  - Measured hot and cold reservoir temperature changes to evaluate heat transfer performance and thermal effectiveness
  - Compared parallel-flow and counterflow configurations, observing temperature crossover behavior unique to counterflow operation
  - Investigated the effects of increased hot inlet temperature and reduced hot-side mass flow rate on system behavior
  - Performed mass, energy, and entropy balance calculations to assess heat losses and irreversibility in a real system

The objective of the assignment was to create a 2D lifting mechanism within a 150 cm × 50 cm design space, using a rigid bar, three pin supports (two ground-mounted), and a linear actuator selected from the provided catalog.
The final design utilizes Actuator RSA, which has a maximum force of 58 kN and an extended length of 1.5 m. Based on static analysis of the structure and actuator geometry, the maximum mass the mechanism can lift was calculated to be 41,834.86 kg.
All components were modeled as rigid, and the configuration was optimized to achieve maximum lifting height within the given design constraints.

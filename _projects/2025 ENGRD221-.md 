<h1>Heat Exchanger Details:</h1><br>
 A heat exchanger transfers thermal energy between two fluid streams without allowing them to mix. The apparatus used in this experiment is a small water-to-water heat exchanger. One closed loop circulates hot water from a heated reservoir, while a second loop carries cold water from a chilled reservoir. The two fluids remain completely separated and do not mix; instead, heat is transferred from the hot stream to the cold stream through the metal wall between the channels. This heat transfer occurs through conduction within the metal and convection between the fluid and the metal surface. <br>

<h1> Operating Conditions Tested:</h1><br>

<h2>Parallel Flow (Control Group):</h2><br>
Both fluids enter and travel in the same direction, so the temperature difference quickly decreases as they move together. This makes the exchanger less effective, limiting the amount of heat transferred and resulting in smaller temperature changes. In the parallel-flow configuration, both the hot and cold fluids entered the heat exchanger at the same end and flowed in the same direction.<br>

Hot reservoir: 43.1 °C → 27.3 °C<br>

Cold reservoir: 4.0 °C → 23.6 °C<br>

<h3>Observations:</h3>
During parallel flow, the metal pump block showed uneven heating. The 2/4 side of the pump consistently became hotter than the 1/3 side associated with the cold flow. This suggests nonuniform heat distribution and possible heat loss to the surroundings. This indicates that the exchanger is not perfectly insulated and that some heat is either lost to the surroundings or not evenly conducted through the metal block.<br>

Counter Flow: The hot and cold streams move in opposite directions, keeping a large temperature difference across the entire heat exchanger. This configuration is much more effective, allowing greater heat transfer and enabling the cold outlet to approach the hot inlet temperature more closely.
Teperature hot the hot increased much more rapidly than the parallel flow.
The hot flow become colder and the cold became hotter in temperature, which is only possible with counter flow

Parallel Flow (Hotter Liquid): A higher hot inlet temperature increases the driving temperature difference and raises the heat-transfer rate. Lowering it weakens heat transfer and reduces cold-side heating.
There were no dramatic changes when increasing the starting temperature in the heat exchanger.

Change of Relative Flow (Tube Pinching): The side with the lower flow rate experiences a larger temperature change and becomes the limiting stream. The higher-flow stream changes temperature less because it carries more thermal mass.
The flow of the slwoed hot restulted in a much smaller amount water in the end bucket, and it had a greater temperature change than the cold.

Heat exchangers appear anywhere heat needs to transfer between fluids without mixing. Examples include car radiators, home HVAC systems, power-plant condensers, industrial process coolers and heaters, refrigeration systems, and renewable-energy systems like geothermal heat pumps.

Even with temperature-controlled reservoirs, the heat exchanger is not perfectly adiabatic. Heat is still lost or gained through:
    the exposed metal body of the exchanger
    uninsulated tubing
    ambient air interacting with the system
These external losses mean the heat gained by the cold stream will be slightly less than the heat lost by the hot stream.

In our setup, the kinetic energy changes are not negligible, because we can physically feel the outside of the heat exchanger becoming warmer during operation. This indicates that pump-driven flow creates noticeable frictional losses and turbulence inside the channels, converting kinetic energy into thermal energy. As a result, some heating occurs due to flow resistance, meaning KE effects contribute to the overall temperature changes.

<h1>Full Wing Iteration 1 Assembly</h1>
Image soon to be added.

<p>
During the 2025–2026 design cycle, I contributed to the development of the full wing assembly by creating and refining CAD models in SolidWorks. I also assisted in the creation and iterative improvement of the elevator SolidWorks CAD files. My work focused on key wing components used to produce the first full-wing iteration of the aircraft for flight testing.<br>

I conducted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses in ANSYS to study the airflow around the nosecone and better understand the aircraft’s aerodynamic behavior. In addition, I performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in ANSYS on the central carbon fiber spar and the wing assembly to evaluate structural response under aerodynamic and mechanical loading. These analyses were used to assess aerodynamic stability and structural performance, with particular attention to load paths and stress distributions in the central carbon fiber spar.<br>

The image above was captured during the first flight test of the iteration 1 aircraft. The test resulted in a successful takeoff, stable flight, and controlled landing, validating the initial wing design and analysis. Additional flight testing was conducted to further evaluate performance and inform subsequent design iterations. Video footage from this flight is provided below.
